# Multiplayer-Boids-game-Urho3d
C++ and Urho3D, players can connect to a server and compete to catch the most fish.

Made using Urho3D C++ and CMake.

This project aimed to produce a game with networking capabilities around the theme of having the player catching fish. 
I opted for a multiplayer design model in which players compete with one another to catch the most fish while playing as sharks.
The project allows users to setup a server for other player clients to then connect to and participate in.

The game provides users with a limited amount of time to catch fish and then compares the scores once time is up to crown a winner.
